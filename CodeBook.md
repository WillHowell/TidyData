The data has been subset to only include mean and standard deviation values for accelerometer and gravity accelerometer readings.  Further study on this dataset is focused on showing that only these values are needed to determine a user activity from smart phone sensor readings with a 95% confidence interval.

The dataset generated with this script include just one file:
=========================================

- TidyData.txt

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Mean values from triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer
- Activity labels
- Anonymous subject IDs

Features in this data set:
